TRADED - PRESS RELEASE BELOW !
· 110 Madison Avenue – Retail Condominium
· Manhattan, NY
· Seller: 110 Madison Housing Development Fund Corporation
· Buyer: Klosed Properties’ Steven Kachanian
· Senior director of Acquisitions: Jacob Namdar
· Broker: Clint Olsen of C&W, who represented both buyer and seller.
· $2,000,000
· PPSF:$1,081
· Closing date: 12/1/2016
Klosed Properties is pleased to announce the purchase of 110 Madison Avenue, exclusively with TradedNY. The subject property is an 1,850 SF Retail Condominium unit located in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan. Located within a recently developed condominium building, the Retail Condo benefits from high visibility and constant foot traffic from residents and tourists alike, given its strong location along the Madison Avenue retail corridor. Klosed would like to thank Clint Olsen of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented both the buyer and seller in this transaction. 
Steven Kachanian, Managing Principal told TradedNY: "We are thrilled about this acquisition based on the location and long term growth potential of the neighborhood. One of the main attractive aspects of the property is the lack of use restrictions and that there is already a ventilation stack to the roof. These features allow us to cater specifically to bars and restaurants. We recognized immediately the value and potential of the property and were able to sign a hard contract within days of inspecting the property." Jacob Namdar, Senior Director of Acquisitions added: "We are looking to grow our presence in Midtown Manhattan, as well as strong pockets in the boroughs. This property is located within just a few blocks from several signature locations, such as Madison Square Park, Flatiron Building, Empire State Building, 230 5th Rooftop, several new high-end developments & hotels." This closing marks Klosed’s 10th acquisition of 2016, while they are currently under contract to purchase 5 additional properties in NYC and the boroughs.
